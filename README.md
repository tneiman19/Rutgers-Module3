# Rutgers-Module3 (Password Generator)

# Task

Provided with starter code, we were tasked with writing a password generator.

- When prompted for the length of the password the user should enter at least 8, and no more than 128 characters

- The user should then confirm if they would like to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, or special characters.

- Once this information is received, a password that matches the selected criteria should be generated and displayed on the web page.

## Additionally:

Host this on GitHub Pages and include a screenshot in this README file as well.
